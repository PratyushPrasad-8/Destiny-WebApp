# Full Stack Web Application  

This is a **Full Stack Web Application** built using **MongoDB**, **Node.js**, **Express**, and **Bootstrap**, following the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** architecture to ensure maintainable and scalable code. Below, you'll find the key features, technologies used, and setup instructions.  

## üåü Features  

### Frontend:  
- **Responsive Design:** Developed using Bootstrap for seamless user experience across devices.  
- **EJS-Mate:** Enhanced templating using layout support for DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles.
- **HTML & CSS:** Used for structuring and styling the application with responsive design principles.

### Backend:  
- **Node.js & Express:** The backbone of the server-side logic.  
- **MongoDB with Mongoose:** Database management, including complex relationships and validations.
- **MongoDB Atlas:** Leveraged MongoDB Atlas for cloud-hosted, highly available, and secure database storage.
- **Authentication & Authorization:**  
  - Secured routes and actions using authentication.  
  - Implemented role-based authorization for granular access control.  
- **Error Handling:**  
  - Centralized error management with custom error classes.  
  - Custom error pages for better user experience.  
- **Validation:**  
  - Client-side validations for instant feedback.  
  - Server-side validations for robust data integrity.  
- **Middleware:** Various middlewares integrated for enhanced functionality.  
- **Session Management:** Used sessions and cookies (both signed and unsigned) to manage user sessions and preferences securely.  
- **Data Storage in Cloudinary:** Images and other media files stored in the cloud for efficient handling and scalability.  

### Deployment:  
The project is deployed on **Render**, ensuring it is live and accessible. 
The data base is made live using **MongoDB Atlas**.

## üèóÔ∏è Project Structure  

The project follows the **MVC Architecture** for clean code separation:  

- **Models:** Define database schemas and relationships using Mongoose.  
- **Views:** EJS templates for dynamic and reusable UI components.  
- **Controllers:** Handle business logic, including authentication, validations, and data manipulations.

## üîë Key Learnings  

While building this project, I gained a deeper understanding of:  
1. **Mongoose Relationships:** Implemented relationships and used populate for efficient querying and data representation.  
2. **Error Handling:** Centralized approach with custom error classes for better debugging and modularity.  
3. **Validation:** Combined client-side and server-side validations for a seamless and secure user experience.  
4. **Middleware:** Custom and third-party middleware integration, including connect-flash, for robust application logic.  
5. **Authentication & Authorization:** Implemented salting for securing passwords and managing both authentication and role-based authorization.
